Hello, <%= @cc.name %>

we are writing to inform you that you will not hear from any more
Braven Fellows for the remainder of the current college semester.

We know your time is valuable and we understand the sacrifice you
make to help our Braven Fellows, which is why we limit each volunteer
to only three students reaching out to them per semester, and you
recently should have heard from the third and final.

Thank you for your time and effort!

- Braven Staff
